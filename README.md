# IRBazooka

This is the initial repository for our IoT Study Group.

The aim of this project is to create an automated way of turning off all the AC units in the office at some specified time, with the intention of reducing our energy consumption. Alexa integration is also on the roadmap, in order to control the AC units with only our voice power.
